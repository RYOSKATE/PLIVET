Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br><br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"<br>      replaced with your own identifying information.

If<br>     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for<br>     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to<br>     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our<br>     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain<br>     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of<br>     the licensed material may still be restricted for other<br>     reasons, including because others have copyright or other<br>     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,<br>     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.<br>     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to<br>     respect those requests where reasonable.

License grant.<br><br>       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,<br>          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br>          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to<br>          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:<br><br>            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or<br>               in part; and<br><br>            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.<br><br>       2. Exceptions and Limitations.

Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section<br>          6(a).<br><br>       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.

No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br>               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br>               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br>               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br>               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br>               Material.<br><br>       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or<br>          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You<br>          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected<br>          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,<br>          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as<br>          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br><br>  b. Other rights.<br><br>       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not<br>          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,<br>          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to<br>          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br>          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br>          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br>          Rights, but not otherwise.<br><br>       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this<br>          Public License.<br><br>       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to<br>          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed<br>          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br>          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br>          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br>          reserves any right to collect such royalties.<br><br><br>Section 3 -- License Conditions.<br><br>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br>following conditions.<br><br>  a. Attribution.<br><br>       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified<br>          form), You must:<br><br>            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor<br>               with the Licensed Material:<br><br>                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed<br>                    Material and any others designated to receive<br>                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by<br>                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if<br>                    designated);<br><br>                ii. a copyright notice;<br><br>               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;<br><br>                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of<br>                    warranties;<br><br>                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the<br>                    extent reasonably practicable;<br><br>            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and<br>               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and<br><br>            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this<br>               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or<br>               hyperlink to, this Public License.<br><br>       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any<br>          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in<br>          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be<br>          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or<br>          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required<br>          information.<br><br>       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the<br>          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent<br>          reasonably practicable.<br><br>       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's<br>          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted<br>          Material from complying with this Public License.<br><br><br>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.<br><br>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br>apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br><br>  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br>     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br>     portion of the contents of the database;<br><br>  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br>     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br><br>  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br>     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.<br><br>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br>replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br>Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br><br><br>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br><br>  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br>     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br>     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br>     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br>     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br>     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br>     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br>     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br>     waiver of all liability.<br><br><br>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br><br>  a.

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br>     Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br><br>       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br>          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br>          violation; or<br><br>       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br><br>     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br>     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br>     of this Public License.<br><br>  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br>     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br>     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br>     will not terminate this Public License.<br><br>  d.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>rights.<br><br>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>authors' reputations.<br><br>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>along with the Program.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>    parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Program.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Program or works based on it.<br><br>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>this License.<br><br>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.<br><br>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>          NO WARRANTY<br><br>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>-----</div><div class="c0">node-int64. <br></div><div class="c1">A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/broofa/node-int64. <br>This software may be included in this product contains the following license and notice below:</div><div class="c2"><br><br>Copyright (c) 2014 Robert Kieffer<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br>all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br><br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>      meet the following conditions:<br><br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br><br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>          stating that You changed the files; and<br><br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>          the Derivative Works; and<br><br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>          as modifying the License.<br><br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>      the conditions stated in this License.<br><br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br><br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br><br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>-----</div><div class="c0">xmlchars. <br></div><div class="c1">A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/lddubeau/xmlchars.git. <br>This software may be included in this product contains the following license and notice below:</div><div class="c2"><br><br>Copyright Louis-Dominique Dubeau and contributors to xmlchars<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of<br>this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in<br>the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to<br>use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of<br>the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,<br>subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all<br>copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS<br>FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
